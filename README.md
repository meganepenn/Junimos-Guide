Description: A tracker for the video game Stardew Valley orginally created by ConcernedApe. The goal of this tracker is for users to save their game progress and easily reference which items they've yet to collect. This minimal design lists the villagers and items in game, along with relevant gameplay information. Additionally, it allows the user to check boxes for each item. 

**TO RUN**

**NOTE ABOUT GITHUB**
* My phone is broken so I cannot authenticate myself into my github account and it just made me reverify myself like a couple hours before I had to submit this. I am pretty sure it is a private repository, so you won't be able to see it, but I can send a public version tomorrow as soon as I can get a new phone!! *
